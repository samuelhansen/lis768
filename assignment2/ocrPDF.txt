ON THE PADE APPROXIMANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
CONTINUED FRACTION AND SERIES OF STIELTJES*

HUBERT S. WALL

INTRODUCTION

The well known series of Stieltjes is a power series with real coeﬂicients:

m ———+——~-

such. that the persymmetric determinants

cn-ly 6n, ' ° ' 2 6211—2 6n, cn+1y ' . ° ’ C2n—l

(n=1, 2, 3, - - - , A051, Baal) are all positive. StieltjesT connected the
series (1) with a continued fraction

012+ 02 +aaz+---
in which all the a.- are real and poSitive, and are uniquely determined by the
c; in accordance with the relations

(3) a2n = Arg/(Ban—l) ’ a2n+l = Bn2/(AnAn+l) -

Conversely, the positive real numbers (1.- (i=1, 2, 3, . - - ) uniquely deter-
mine coeﬂicients c.- of a Stieltjes power series. T hus to every Stieltjes con-
tinued fraction (2) with positive a.- there corresponds a Stieltjes series (1)
and vice versa.

In the work of Stieltjes the convergents of (2) separate into two sets,
the odd and the even convergents. When the seriesi Ea; is divergent, these

two sets of alternate convergents have one and the same limit which is a
function analytic throughout the complex plane, excepting the whole or a
part of the negative real axis. When, on the other hand, the series Ea;
converges, these two sets have distinct limits pl/ql and p/q respectively,
which are meromorphic functions having only simple poles all of which are
real and non-positive. The numerators and denominators 12, 121, q, ql are ana-
lytic functions between which there is the relation

(4) P14 — P91 = +1.

In the case of a convergent Stieltjes series (1) the former alternative is
always'realized, but for a divergent series either alternative may be realized.
Thus for some divergent series the continued fraction of Stieltjes picks out
two functional equivalents, while for others only a single equivalent is yielded.

In this article it Will berconvenient to replace 1/2 by z in (1) and (2) and
then drop the unessential factor 2. We then have the Stieltjes series

(5) Co—Clz+6222—6323+"°
with the same inequalities:
(6) A" > 0, B, > 0,
while the continued fraction becomes

1 z z z-
(7)

01+02+ 03+ a4+°°-.
When Ea.- is convergent, the two sets of alternate convergents have
limits which are distinct and meromorphic over the entire plane except at

the origin, while if 2a.- is divergent both sets have the same limit which

is a function analytic over the entire plane except the whole or a part of the
negative real axis.

where Nm,,.(z)/D,.,n(z) is the rational fraction, taken in its lowest terms,
in which the degrees of numerator and denominator do not exceed n and m
respectively, and whose expansion into a power series, P(z), agrees With (8)
for a greater number of terms than any other such rational fraction.

If a particular approximant does not appear more than once in the table,
that approximant is said to be normal, and When every approximant is
normal, the table is called normal. The power series P(z) for a normal
approximant, in Which neceSsarily the degrees of numerator and denominator
are exactly n and m respectively, agrees With the given series term by term
up to and including the term of degree m+n and no further.

Professor Van Vleck* showed that the series of Stieltjes (5) has a normal
Padé table. The odd convergents of the continued fraction (7) ﬁll the
principal diagonal of the table, While the even convergents ﬁll the parallel
diagonal ﬁle immediately below it. Consequently these two diagonal ﬁles
of approximants Will either converge to a common limit analytic throughout
the entire plane except over the Whole or a part of the negative real axis,
or to two distinct functions, meromorphic everywhere except at the origin,
according as Ea; diverges or converges.

The ﬁrst main question which I have considered in this article is the
following:

1. What holds regarding ,the convergence of the other diagonal ﬁles parallel
to the principal diagonal in the Padé table for the series of S tieltjes?

I ﬁnd that the sequence of convergents in any ﬁle parallel to the principal
diagonal converges to a limit. Three cases arise.

Case I. If the series 2a.- is convergent, no two ﬁles to the right of and
parallel to the principal diagonal have the same limit, and no two parallel
ﬁles below the principal diagonal have the same limit. In this case all the
limit functions are meromorphic over the entire plane except at the origin.
The poles of the limits of the ﬁles to the right of the principal diagonal are
all simple and lie upon the negative half of the real axis.

When 2a.- diverges there are two possibilities which exist, namely:

Case II. The ﬁle of approximants in the principal diagonal and the
successive parallel ﬁles to the right of it up to the nth ﬁle inclusive converge
to one and the same limit, while subsequent to the nth they converge to
distinct limits. Likewise the successive parallel ﬁles below the principal
diagonal, doWn to an mth ﬁle inclusive, may converge to the same limit,
While subsequent to the mth ﬁle they converge to distinct limits.

94 H. S. WALL [January

All the limit functions in this case are meromorphic over the entire plane
except at the origin.

Case III. Every diagonal ﬁle parallel to the principal diagonal converges
to one and the same function, which is analytic over the entire plane excepting
the whole or a part of the negative half of the real axis.

In Case I, the series (5) diverges, while in Cases II and III it may either
diverge or converge. Whereas Stieltjes obtained two distinct functional
equivalents of the divergent series (5) in Case I, we now have an inﬁnite set;
and whereas Stieltjes obtained a single functional equivalent when 2a;
diverges, I obtain an inﬁnite number in Case II, and but one in Case III.

Generalizing (1), I shall call any series

(9) f(CoZ" — Clzﬂ‘l‘l + C2zﬂ+2 _ . . . ),

in which n is a positive or negative integer or zero, a Stieltjes series if the
coefﬁ cients c.- satisfy the Stieltjes inequalities (6).

If the ﬁrst n terms of (5) be removed, the remainder is still a Stieltjes
series. Instead of removing terms I have concerned myself with the following
question:

2. Can the series (5) be so continued to the left by successive addition of new
terms that the extended series shall be S tieltjes series?

I ﬁnd that the necessary and suﬂicient condition for a ﬁrst extension
is that the series Saw with even subscripts, shall converge.

Two cases arise:

Case A. If the series 2a.- converges, the Stieltjes series (5) may be
extended to the left by the addition of an arbitrary number of new terms,
forming thereby a series whose coeﬂicients satisfy the Stieltjes inequalities
(6). The coeﬂicients of the preﬁxed terms are not unique.

Case B. If the series 2a.- diverges and 202; converges, the series (5)
may be extended by the addition of a term, —c_lz-1, in which (3.1 may be
taken equal to or greater than 2025. If 6-1 >Za2;, further extension is never
possible; but if c-1=2a2.«, the like series Zaé; in the new Stieltjes continued
fraction belonging to the extended series may or may not converge. If it does
converge, a second extension is possible. The coeﬂicient of the new term,
0-22—2, preﬁxed may be taken equal to or greater than Zaég. Only if 6.:
=2:th can a third term be preﬁxed, and so on.

When n terms can be preﬁxed, all the coeﬂicients in the added terms are
unique with the exception of c_,.. For an inﬁnite extension all the coefﬁcients
are unique. There exist series which can be extended to just 72 terms and
others which can be inﬁnitely extended.

CHAPTER I. THE FADE TABLE OF APPROXIMANTS

To each pair of non-negative integers (m, n) there corresponds one
rational function of the complex variable z=x+z°y: N ,,.,,.(z) /D,,'.,,.(z) taken
in its lowest terms, in which the degrees of numerator and denominator do
not exceed n and m respectively, and whose expansion into a series in ascend—

ditions that the series

are different from zero.* We will henceforth assume the normality of the
table.

In a normal table Padé distinguished three types of regular continued
fractions. We shall need to use here the stairlike type. This is obtained by
starting from a border element of the table of approximants, and passing
hence alternately one step to the right and one downward or vice versa.
If, for example, we start from the nth element of the upper border of the table
and proceed hence one step to the right and one down alternately, we get
the sequence of approximants

No.n—1(Z) No,n(Z) N1.n(Z) N1.n+1(z) . . .
Do.n—1(Z) Do.n(2) D1,n(z) D1,n+l(z)

If we start with the corner element of the table and proceed hence one

approximants

It is to be understood that A_1,o is to be taken here and hereafter equal to
unity.

If now the continued fraction (16) converges, the two adjacent diagonal
ﬁles of the table from which (15) is obtained by selecting approximants
from each alternately, converge to one and the same limit, namely the limit
of (16). On the other hand, if these two diagonal ﬁles converge to separate

limits, the sequences of alternate convergents of (16) must have separate limits.

It is easily seen that not only does the series (8) uniquely determine the
continued fraction (19) in the case of a normal table but conversely (19)
determines the series. The study of the convergence of the ﬁles of approxi-
mants parallel to the principal diagonal of the table can therefore be made to
depend upon the sequence of numbers a.- in (19). In the next chapter such a
study is made for the diagonal ﬁles to the right of the principal diagonal of
the table in the case of the continued fraction of Stieltjes.

To investigate the convergence of the diagonal ﬁles below the principal
diagonal Which start on the left border of the table, I ﬁnd it desirable to turn
to the Padé table of the reciprocal series

(20) 60 + 612 + 6222 + 532:3 + - . . ,
Which is determined by the identity
(21) (ko+klz+'°')(5o+5lz+“‘)=1-

The approximant corresponding to (m, n) for this series is the reciprocal of
the approximant corresponding to (n, m) for the original series (8) ;. and When,
as supposed, the Padé table of (8) is normal, the table of the reciprocal series
is also normal, inasmuch as the ﬁrst m+n+_1 terms of the latter series are
determined by the ﬁrst m+n+1 terms of the former and conversely. Thus
the question of the convergence of the diagonal ﬁles to the left of the principal
diagonal in a normal Padé table may be replaced by the consideration of the

convergence of the diagonal ﬁles to the right of the principal diagonal in the
table of the reciprocal series.

Let now N,’.,,,.(z)/D,’,,,,.(z), m>n, be an approximant of the series (20).

Then
(22) DIM. = w(m,n — m) Nmm,
(23) N;,m = w(m,n — m)D,,.,,.,

where w(m, n—m) is a numerical factor independent of 2. By (13), (14) the
relation (22) may be written

We see from (29) that the value of w(m, n) given by (30) is correct for

all values of n if m = 1.
I shall assume the correctness of formula (30) for all values of it when

m=1, 2, 3, - - - , p—l, and prove, on that hypothesis, that it is correct for

m =1), and hence for all m.

‘ Cf. Hadarhard, Liouville’s Journal, (4), vol. 8 (1892), §24, p. 138. Hadamard obtains (25)
with w(m, n) as in (30) but by a different method.

But by the above mentioned rule for multiplying a determinant by one of its
minors, the quantity within the bracket is equal to —A,.+,_1,,_2/A,,+,_2,,_1.
Consequently, (32) may be written

Comparison of (25) and (33) shows that the value of w(m, n) as given by
(30) is correct for m = p, as was to be proved.
As particular instances of (25) we have

(34) "1.1.... = (_1)mAm—1.m/k02m’
(35) Am’-l.m—l = ( — 1)"“1A:pz-2.m/kozm-l -

Due to symmetry of the identity (21), the 6,- and the k.- may be inter-
changed in (35), giving the relation

(36) mI—2.m = (— 1)m—1Am—l,m—l/k02m—1.

We will now consider the continued fraction of the form (19) belonging
to the normal* series

If we denote by a.’ the a,- obtained from (37), then by (34), (35), and (36) we
obtain

I pass now to the series of Stieltjes

(5) co—clz-chzz—n

The work of the preceding chapter is applicable here if we replace through-
out k2; by 62; and kaH by —62.'_1. In particular the continued fraction (16)

becomes*

Where G,.(z)=co—c1z+ - - - +(-—1)"“lc,._lz"—l and the 0;" are obtained by
replacing every kg," by (-1)"c.-+n in (17). It is easily seen that now, in place
of (17), we have

0;: = A3—1,i+n-1/[Ai—1,i+nAi—2,i+n_1] ,
(41) n

02i+1 = Aig—l,i+n/ [Ai—1.i+n—1Ai,i+n],
,in which it is to be understood that the Am,” are the same as in Chapter I
with every k; replaced by c.-.

In particular,

02; = Aiz/(BiBi—l) = A3—1,i—1/(Ai_1,iAi—gJ—i),
a2£+1 = Biz/(Av‘AHl) = A3—1,£/(Ai—1,i_1Ai.i).

Thus each a.” is obtained from the corresponding a.- by means of the
substitution of cm. for 6,- throughout.

Since, by'hypothesis, An and B”, for n=1, 2, 3, - . - , are positive, all
the determinants Am,n formed from them by removing the ﬁrst r rows
and r columns are positiveT Therefore, in (40), the bracketed part,

is a continued fraction of Stieltjes with positive a;”. We may therefore apply
his convergence results for the continued fraction (2), bearing in mind that,
as noted in the introduction, 2 has been replaced by 1/2 in (2) and then the
factor 2 has been dropped. It is readily seen that if P.?(z), Q;(z) denote the
numerator and denominator of the convergents of (2) (after a.- has been re-

The sequence of convergents accordingly separates into two sets, the even
and the odd convergents. Stieltjes showed that when Ea? is convergent,
the numerators and denominators of the even convergents converge to
limits p(z), g(z) respectively; likewise those of the odd convergents to limits
p1(z), q1‘(z), and these limits are entire functions whose zeros all lie upon the
negative half of the real axis. These functions are connected by the relation

(44) P1(Z)q(2) - P(Z)q1(2) = 1.

On the other hand, when 2a? is divergent, the even and the odd convergents
Converge to a common function F (2) which is analytic over the entire plane
excepting the whole or a part of the negative half of the real axis.

If now we denote the ith convergent of (40) by U .-(z)/ V,-(z), we have

The odd and even convergents of (40) ﬁll respectively the nth and (n+1)st
diagonal ﬁles of the Padé table. When 2a,” is convergent, they have separate
limits in consequence of the foregoing results of Stieltjes, and these limits

are meromorphic over the entire plane except at z=0, with poles lying only
upon the negative half of the real axis. If now we put

W) = Game) — <— z) "-112 (313—)
2(2) = q<é>

the limit of the even convergents U 2,-(2) / V2;(z), for i= 0° , is u(z)/22(z). Simi-
larly the limit of the odd convergents will be u1(z)/v1(z) where ul and v1

are the same as u and 7) except that p, q are replaced by p1, ql. In consequence
of (44) we have the relation

(46) “(2)v1(2) - u1(z)v(Z) = (— Z)“-

When 2a.” is divergent, the application of the results of Stieltjes to (45)
shows immediately that the two sets of convergents have a common limit
which is analytic over the entire plane except the whole or a part of the
negative real axis. We conclude therefore that whether Ea.” converges or
diverges every diagonal ﬁle of approximants to the right of the principal
diagonal converges.

For a complete discussion of the relationship between the limits of these
ﬁles we shall need to connect our successive series 2a? with the primary
series Zag. For that purpose I shall now obtain expressions for the a.” in
terms of the a?-1.

Let the numerator and denominator of the ith convergent of (40) be
denoted by U 2‘ (z) and V? (2). Except for a common numerical factor, these
may be obtained from (13) and (14). Thus, in particular, on setting m=k

verge but Za§;_1 may either converge or diverge, etc. Proceeding in this
manner we perceive that in addition to the possibility of the convergence of

all 2a.”, n=0, 1, 2, - - - , Case I, there are just two other possibilities:
either, Case II, all of the series 2a,", n=0, 1, 2, . - . , will diverge; or else,
Case III, the ﬁrst r will diverge while all subsequent to the rth will converge.

It remains to see that both the last possibilities can be realized. For this
purpose the following lemma will be established.

Construct now a Stieltjes continued fraction for which lim (a2.-+1 / (12,--1) =3,

lim(a2.-/a2.-_2) :7. Let O<r<1, s>1. Then by the lemma and (49), (50)
for n =1 we obtain

lim (d;.‘+1/d;i..1)= r32, lim (aég/aépg) = 1/3.

If we so choose 5 that rsz<1, 1/s<1, then Ea.- will diverge while 21.1
will converge; But if rs”>1, 1/s<1, 2a} as well as 2a.- will diverge. In

the latter event, we may again apply the lemma and (49), (50) for n =2 and
obtain '

lim (a:;+1/a:.-_1) = r233, lim (0225/03.;2) = 1/ (r32).

If we so choose 3 that rs’> 1, r2s3<1, the series 20;, Ext.-1 will diverge,
while 2a,? will converge. But if r233 > 1, 1/(rs’) <1, 2a., Ea} , and 2a? will
all diverge, and we may again apply the lemma, etc.

Continuing in this manner we ﬁnd that if 0<r< 1, 1/r("‘l)/ k<s<
1/r*/‘*+1), all of the series 20;, 2a}, - - - , Ea?" will diverge, while the
series Zaf, Ea? +1, - - - , will converge. When 3; 1/7, all of the series Zaﬁ,
n =0, 1, 2, 3, - - - , are divergent. Thus the two possibilities indicated above
when 2a,- is divergent can be realized.

Whenever the Stieltjes series (5) is convergent, the series cn—anz

+cn+222- ~ - ~ , n=1, 2, 3, - - - , are convergent, and therefore the numbers
1/(az'a, +1), i=1, 2, 3, - . - , must be bounded for each n=1, 2, 3, - - ~ .*
Hence none of the associated series 2a.”, n = 1, 2, 3, - - - , can be convergent.

These associated series may also diverge even when the Stieltjes series (5)
is divergent. For consider the Stieltjes continued fraction for which 025-1
=1/(ir‘), a2;=r‘, O<r<1. In this the numbers 1/(a.~a.-+1) increase without
limit, and lim(a2;+1/a2.--1)=1/r, lim(a2.-+2/a2.-)=r. Accordingly the series
(5) and the associated series diverge.

We have seen that there are three cases which arise. Of these we will now
consider the ﬁrst.

Case I. The series Ea.- is convergent.

T hen by Theorem 3 all the series 2a,”, 12 = 1, 2, 3, - - - , converge. Hence
by the discussion at the beginning of the chapter, all the diagonal ﬁles of
approximants which lie to the right of the principal diagonal have limits
which are meromorphic over the entire plane excepting z=0; with poles
lying only on the negative half of the real axis; and the limits for no two

successive ﬁles are identical.
To show that no two of these diagonal ﬁles have the same limit, I will

show that for two of the denominators 21,, of these limits the roots of 22,.(1/2)
(diﬂerent from 0) nearest the origin are distinct.

Stieltjes found that the roots of Q2k(z) and Q2k+l(z) for (2) are all real,
non-positive, distinct, and separate each other. The former is of degree k
and has no root equal to zero, while the latter is of degree k+1 and has a
zero root. The same is true of Q3142), and Q3k+1(z), obtained from these by

"‘ Cf. Stieltjes, loc. cit., §10.

replacing a.- by a-r. If then we denote by mm and 715"“) the non-Zero root
nearest the origin of Q3k(z) and Q3k+1(z), we have

rk(")>rk("+1)- (n=1,2,3,--- ;k=1,2,3,"‘).

But 1'15"“) is also the non-zero root nearest the origin of Q3k+l(z). If then we
let k—WO, 71“") will approach a limit Rn750, and this limit is the non-zero
root nearest the origin of the limit function vn(1/z).* We have

(ﬂ) Egkguﬁg&2~

The equality sign can nowhere hold in (51), since, by (46), 1),.(1/2) and
vn+1(1/z) cannot vanish for the same value of 2 not zero, and therefore
Rn¢Rn+1 for all values ”of n. The distinctness of the functions 22,.(1/2)
therefore follows, and hence no two diagonal ﬁles can converge to the same
limit.

Case II. All the series 2a.”, n= 1, 2, 3, - - - , diverge.

Any two consecutive diagonal ﬁles to the right of and parallel to the
principal diagonal converge to the same limit, and hence all these ﬁles have
a common limit. The limit is analytic throughout the complex plane except-
ing the whole or a part of the negative half of the real axis.

Case III. The series 2a,”, n=1, 2, 3, . ' ~ , r, diverge while Zaﬁ“,
j=1, '2, 3, 4, - - - , converge.

By the ﬁrst part of the hypothesis the principal diagonal and all parallel
ﬁles on its right up to the (r+1)th diagonal ﬁle inclusive converge to one and
the same limit, while by virtue of the second part of the hypothesis all the
ﬁles beginning with the (r+1)th converge to limits which are meromorphic
over the entire plane except at 2 =0. T hus the limits of all these ﬁles are of
the same meromorphic character, but the distinctness of the limits begins
only on passing the (r+1)th ﬁle.

We will now turn our attention to the diagonal ﬁles below the principal
diagonal which start with an approximant on the vertical border of the
Padé table. Instead of considering directly the convergence of these diagonal
ﬁles of approximants, we may consider instead the convergenCe of their
reciprocals which are ﬁles of approximarits to the right of the principal
diagonal of the Padé table for the reciprocal series of (5). Let this be

(ﬂ) %+dw+@ﬁ+-~.

By (34) and (35) the determinants An and B" with every 6.- replaced by

belongs (Theorem 1, Chapter I) a Stieltjes continued fraction

1 z z
a2+ds+a4+‘°'.

Consequently (53) is a Stieltjes series and we may apply the results previously
obtained for (7) and (43) using (53) as our primary series.

Three cases may be distinguished.

Case I. If the series 2a.- converges, the diagonal ﬁles of approximants
for (53) to the right of the principal diagonal converge each to a different
function, which is meromorphic except at z=0 with poles only on the
negative half of the real axis. Consequently the diagonal ﬁles of approximants
for (5) below the principal diagonal converge, each to a different function,
which is meromorphic except at 2 =0 with zeros only on the negative half of
the real axis.

If Ea.- is divergent, two cases may be distinguished corresponding to II
and III above.

Case II. If all the diagonal ﬁles of approximants for (53) to the right
of the principal diagonal have a common limit F1(z), then those below the
principal diagonal for (5) have the limit F (2) =1/(do+zF1), which is the limit
of the continued fraction (7), and is analytic except over all or a part of the
negative real axis.

Case III. If the ﬁrst r ﬁles of approximants of (53) to the right of the
principal diagonal have the same limit, while after passing the rth ﬁle the
limits are distinct, then in the table of approximants of (5) the ﬁles below
the principal diagonal will have the same limit until after passing the (r+1)th
ﬁle, whereupon they become distinct from one another. The limit functions
are all meromorphic except at z=0 with zeros only on the negative half of
the real axis.

One may ask the question whether, if the rth and (r+1)th diagonal ﬁles
to the right of the principal diagonal have a common [diﬁerent] limit
[limits], a corresponding pair of adjacent ﬁles below the principal diagonal
must have a common [different] limit [limits]. In Case I the answer is
obviously in the afﬁrmative, for then all the ﬁles to the right of and also
those below the principal diagonal have distinct limits. In Case II when (5)
converges, since its reciprocal also converges, both the series 2a.”, n=0,
1, 2, 3, - ~ - , and the series similarly associated with (54) (which we shall
denote for future reference by 2a.”, n=0, 1, 2, ~ - . , aﬂaa,+1) must all
diverge. Hence all the ﬁles have the same limit. Also for the divergent
Stieltjes series for which a2i=r‘, azi_1=1/(z'r‘), 0<r<1 (Chapter II) it is
easily veriﬁed that Ear, 201,“, n =0, 1, 2, 3, - . - , all diverge. F inally, when

(54)

108 H. S. WALL [January

lim((12¢/02;_2)=7, lim(a2,-+1/a2;_1)=s, 0<r<1, s>1, it may be easily seen
that aze+1/a3;_1 and azi‘ﬂ/azﬁll both have the limit rnsn+1 for z' = 00. Conse-
quently (except possibly when r"s"+1 = 1):}:a.” and Ear“ converge or diverge
together. In all these examples pairs of adjacent ﬁles equally distant from
the ﬁrst diagonal ﬁle below the principal diagonal behave alike (i.e. the two
ﬁles in each pair have a common limit Or else they have distinct limits).
In the following example pairs of adjacent ﬁles equidistant from the prin-
Cipal diagoﬁ‘al behave alike. ChoOse (12.43 =b.-/(a2+a4+ - - - +a2.-+2)’,
where beis any convergent positive—term series. Then Zaég+1=2bg
converges and hence by Theorem 3 all 2d.” converge. But if Zam- is diver-
gent, 2a;, 2a} are divergent, but 2052 and all subsequent series are con-
vergent.

Now we shall examine the zeros and poles of the approximants
N m,,.(z) /D,,.,,.(z) of the Stieltjes series (5). If ngm, these by (45) are equal
to 'Ggp+1(z) —z”Pp,-(1/z)/Q,-(1/z), Where j =2»: or 2m+1 according as
11—»: =2p or 2p+ 1; and if n <m their reciprocals, by the discussion centering
about (52), are equal to do+d1z+ - - - +dgp+1z29+1+22P+1Pj”(1/z)/Q,-”(1/z),
where‘Pj”/Q,-" is of the same form as P,-/Q,- and j =2n or 2n+1 according
as m—n=2p+1 or 2p+2. If we replace 2 by 1/2 and set G”1 (2) =do+dlz
+ . - - +d,,_lz""1, these become

G (1) 1P,-<z> d G,(1>+ 1 P;'<z>
2’“ z 22? Qg-(Z) an 2” z z2v+1 Q/'(z)’

where P,-(z)/Qj(z) and P,-”(z)/Q,-"(z) are the jth convergents of Stieltjes
continued fractions of the form (2). Now it follows from the work of
Stieltjes that when ngm—l the roots pf the polynomials Dm,,.(z) are all
distinct and lie on the negative half of the real axis. If ngm the same is
true of the roots of Nm,,.(z). If n=m or m— 1, all the roots of Nm,,.(z) and
Dm,,.(z) are real and alternate along the negative half of the real axis. Con-
sider now the roots of the numerator and denominator of an arbitrary
approximant N ”M(z) /D,,.,,.(z). In the above representation for it, P,-(z)/Q,-(z)
and P;”(z)/Q,~”(z) are monotone functions of z which decrease from + co to
--00 as z increases between two adjacent roots of the denominators.*
But the polynomials G..(1/z) and G,,’ (1 /z) are continuous and bcunded in
any interval not containing the origin. Hence G2p+1(1/z) becomes equal to
P,-(z)/zsz,-(z) at least once between every two adjacent non-zero roots of
Qj(z). Therefore if n>m, N m,,.(z) vanishes at least once between every two
adjacent roots of Dm,”(z); similarly, z'f n<m—-1, Dm,,.(z) vanishes at least
once between every two adjacent roots of N m,n(z).

CHAPTER III. EXTENDED STIELTJES SERIES

I pass now to the question whether, given the Stieltjes series (5), it is
possible to ﬁnd a number 0-1 such that the series

(55) _ C—lz—l + Co — 612 + 6222 —' ' ' °

shall be a Stieltjes series, i.e. such that the determinants An and B,. in terms
of the coefﬁcients of (55) shall all be positive. The Bu for (55), being the A“

for the original series (5), are positive. Consequently it is both necessary
and sufﬁcient for the extension that a number t=c_1>0 shall exist such that

t 60 . . . Ci

Ci ' ' ' 02i+1

shall be positive for all values of i =0, 1, 2, 3, - - - .
N ow

(56) few 5 A;,.~+11 t+f¢(0) -

Since the coeﬂicient of t in (56) is positive, 6-1 must be taken greater than
the root of f;(t), i.e. greatenthan

(57) ti = — fi(0)/Ai,i+1,
for all values of 2'. It follows that the extension is possible when and only
when the numbers t;, i =0, 1, 2, - - - , have an upper bound.
Now*
(58) ti = a2 + 04 + ' ' ' + 0214-2-
In fact, by the rule for multiplying a determinant by one of its minors
(59) fi(t)'Ai—l,i = '—1(t)Ai.i+1 — Agi-

If we divide both members of this equation by A;-1,.-A.-,.-+1 and then replace
ibyi—1,z'-2, - - - , 3, 2,1, 0, we have with the aid of (42)

02i+2 = fi—l(t)/Ai—l,i — fi(t)/Ai.i+1,
02; = fi—-2(t)/Ai—2.i—1 — fi—1(t)/Ai—l.t')

G4 = fo(t)/Ao.1 ‘— f1(t)/A1,2.

* Stieltjes, lob. cit., §35, eq. 11, obtained this in a different manner.

License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see http://www.ams.org/journaI-terms-of-use
110 H. S. WALL [January

If to these equations we adjoin the identity
02 = t — fo(t)/Ao.1,

and then add them together and set t=t.~, we obtain (58).

It follows from (58) that the numbers ti, i=0, 1, 2, - - - , will have an
upper bound when and only when the series 202; is convergent. When
this condition is satisﬁed, we may take c_1=2a2.-+a where a is zero or an
arbitrary positive number. We state this result in the following theorem.

THEOREM 4. Given a S tieltjes series

(5) CO—Clz+6222—-'°‘,
there exists a Stieltjes series
(55) “ 0—12‘1 + Co — 612 + 6222 — . - -

when and only when the series 202; in the Stieltjes continued fraction belonging
to (5) is convergent.

When the condition is fulﬁlled the number c_1 may be taken equal to Zam-
or any greater number.

Let us now suppose that Ea.- in (7) is convergent. Denote by*

1 z z
ar1+-a§1+-a€1+----
the Stieltjes continued fraction belonging to (55), in which the (1,71 are
necessarily positive. We must now express the an‘1 in terms of the an, which
is obviously the same problem as that of expressing the a.- ‘1 in terms of the
(13‘. To do this we will need to develop some necessary formulas.

If we equate the two values of t.-_2 obtained from (57) and (58), and then
advance the subscripts of every 6.- by n, we get the equation

(60)

(61) 02" + a4" + ' ° ' + 0:92 = _fi:2(O)/Ai—2.n+i-1,
where

(62) Ai-l.n+i—2 = fin—2(O) + Cn—lAi—2.n+i—l;

and therefore (61) may be written in the form

(63) Ai-l.n+i-2 = fin—2(O).(Cn—l — 20;).

Squaring the members of (63) and multiplying them into the correspond-

(65) a2:‘=a;‘.--l(cn_1— 02,.) (i=2,3,4,~-);

while for i=1 we have

while for 2' =0, 1 we have
(68) aln—l = l/Cn—l ; aan—l = az"/[¢n-1(Cn—1 — 02"”-

Then we have, setting n=0, c_1=Za2.-+a, a>0, in (65), (67),

Hence since 2a.- is convergent, it follows that Earl is also convergent.
We may now take 0-2 =2a§§+aﬂ where 0’ >0, and extend (55) to form
the Stieltjes series

(69) 6-23-2 — _C_1Z—1 + Co — 612 + 6222 —- . . . ,

etc.
Continuing in this manner, we see that the series (5) can be extended
indeﬁnitely to the left. We have proved the following theorem:

License or copyright restrictions may apply to redistribution; see http://www.ams.org/journaI-terms-of-use
112 H. S. WALL [January

THEOREM 5. If in the Stieltjes continued fraction belonging to the Stieltjes

series

(5) CO _ 612 + 6222 — ' -

the series 2a.- converges, then the series (5) can be extended to the left by preﬁxz’ng
anyﬁm'te or inﬁnite number of terms: — c-lz‘l, + c_2z-2, —- c_3z-3, . . . ,

in such wise that the extended series shall be Stieltjes series.
The coeﬁcients in the preﬁxed terms are not unique.

Let us next suppose the series 2a.- to diverge. By Theorem 4, 2a,.-
must converge in order that extension shall be possible, and consequently
Zd2{_1 is divergent. We then take 6-1 =Za25+0, where a is zero or a positive
number. I shall prove that unless a=0, the series Ea}: will be divergent,
and therefore further extension will be impossible. In fact, by (65), if
0750, a2r1>02a2,-_1, i=1, 2, 3, - - . , and therefore each term of Zagrl is
greater than the corresponding term of the divergent series o’ZazH so that
extension is impossible.

When 0750, it has been shown that Zazrl is necessarily divergent. I
shall give examples presently to show that When a=0, 204:1 may either
converge or diverge. On the former hypothesis Zaziill must be divergent,
and therefore also Earl. For suppose the contrary. Then by Theorem 3,
since Earl converges, Zag, 2a}, - - - converge. But by hypothesis Ea;
is divergent. We thus have a contradiction. Hence:

According to the hypothesis we may take a ﬁxed integer m suﬂiciently
large to insure that for all ngm the quotient b,./b,.+,c will lie between
(1 /r*) — 5/4 and (1 /r*) +e/4, where e is an arbitrarily small assigned positive
number. T hen

bm+bm+1+ ' "+bm+p -
bm-Hc + bm+k+1 + ’ ' ' + bm+lc+p

will lie between these same limits inasmuch as the terms are all of the same
sign and the ratio of each term of the numerator to the corresponding term
of the denominator lies between these limits. But since Zb‘ is convergent
there will be a limit to this fraction for p—mo which lies between these
limits.

As e may be taken as small as desired by taking m suﬂiciently large, the
lemma accordingly results.

Construct now a Stieltjes continued fraction in which 02,-=r", lim.-_..

If we now choose r so that 723 <1, then 202 1 will be convergent and both a
ﬁrst and second extension of (5) is possible. This requires that we have

Hence extension of' (5) to the left for la terms is then possible, but a further
extension is impossible. If r =1/s, an extension of inﬁnite order is possible.

The following theorem follows immediately from (49), (50) of the preced-

series.
To determine the c;, write

Since lim(c;/c¢_1)=4 it follows that the radius of convergence of (73)

is equal to 1/4.
We will next get the elements in the associated continued fractions.
