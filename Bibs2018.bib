	abstract = {This is neither a commentary on the preceding papers nor a summary of the discussions held on January 24. Rather, I will try to give a sense of various views expressed by the presenters, identify the issues raised in light of the subsequent discussions, and highlight the implications of the day’s proceedings. Some Ground Rules In his seminal work, Principia Ethica, the moral philosopher and epistemologist G. E. Moore remarked that, in most complex matters, difficulties and disagreements “are mainly due to a very simple cause: namely to attempt to answer questions, without first discovering precisely what question it is which you desire to answer” ([1902] 1988). Conference participants clearly agreed about the question: What is an authentic digital object, and what are the core elements that, if missing, would render that object something other than what it purports to be? The difficulties arose from participants’ legitimate, and perhaps predictable, disagreements about which elements are intrinsic to a digital object and which elements are contingent on context, technologies, encoding schemes and display methods, or other externalities. As anticipated, communities differ in their understanding of what constitutes intrinsic features of a digital object; these differences mirror their understanding of authenticity of analog objects. After all, the uses of digital and analog information by historians, archivists, publishers, or scientists vary greatly. Most of the workshop participants grounded their thinking about digital objects and their identity in the fitness of these objects for some specified function or purpose, such as a record that bears evidence; a historical source that bears witness to an event, a time, or a life; or data that could produce a replicable experiment. In other words, what was deemed intrinsic to an object was determined by the purpose for which it was created (or, in the case of archival records, the most narrowly defined of digital objects under discussion, the purpose of bearing evidence about an object’s creation and intended use). Regrettably, as Moore pointed out, evidence cannot be adduced for things intrinsic. “From no truth, except themselves alone, can it be inferred that [intrinsic things] are either true or false.” The Key Issues Perhaps for that reason if no other, neither the presenters nor the workshop participants addressed systematically and directly the question of what an authentic digital object is and what the core attributes are that, if missing, would render the object something other than what it purports to be. However, threaded throughout the discussion were various responses to the other questions raised in the charge. · If all information–textual, numeric, audio, and visual–exists as a bit stream, what does that imply for the concept of format and its role as an attribute essential to the object? Clifford Lynch proposed a hierarchy of complexity of representation: bit stream, data, documents, interactive objects (i.e., engaging sensory perceptions), and experiential works (e.g., virtual reality). That schema resonated with many of the participants. David Levy pointed out that we might never resolve the paradox of bits being “the stuff” with the fact that bits are inaccessible to our senses and perceptual abilities. This is not how we have dealt with recorded information before. Given that we are just beginning to explore the relationship between humans and computing machines, it is hard to think ahead about how we, as physical creatures, will relate to virtual bits. In the analog realm, many features of recorded information are an aspect of the object itself and so will not translate into the digital environment. We are generally unaware of how often we use our judgment about the physical integrity of recorded information to stand in for a judgment about the integrity of the text. We make instantaneous inferences about a text that we receive with portions blacked out. Evidence provided by the physical object, however, has no counterpart in the digital world; deletions in an electronic text would not be visible to the eye and, consequently, would not raise our suspicion. A digital object has no independent physical manifestation that can accrete information about its fate in this world (such as bookplates, marginalia, coffee mug stains, and so forth). For similarly effective external evidence for a digital object, we must create such things as metadata, which in turn create their own preservation and readability concerns. Once metadata are separated from their object, it is hard to reattach them. It is a fact of life on the Internet that in e-mail correspondence, content will be cut and pasted into some extraneous document and then widely disseminated without its originating contextual metadata. Cutting and pasting in the analog world, by contrast, leave physical traces that can alert the recipient or reader to the document’s provenance. · Does the concept of an original have meaning in the digital environment? David Levy defined the copying of digital information as a manufacturing process. In effect, a digital file is like a printing plate. Bits may be the source of a document, but they are not and can never be the original. Moreover, there are no unique copies in the digital realm unless they result from a mistake in the manufacturing process, that is, the process of copying the file onto the screen.Jeff Rothenberg argued strongly for the opposite point of view, saying that a digital-original is any representation of a digital informational entity that has the maximum possible likelihood of retaining all meaningful and relevant aspects of the entity. This echoed the archival point of view, which suggests that the digital-original is just the same (i.e., works in just the same way) as the analog original. The value of an original is that it is as complete as possible and it is reliable because of the control exercised in its creation. In an archives, the digital-original is simply the first record received. But this begs the question of what we really mean by “original.” In the case of a digital file, we are referring not to an object per se, but to a fixed set of Read More},

	abstract = {Modern information systems not only capture a seemingly endless amount of transactional data, but also tend to retain it for indefinite periods of time. We argue that privacy policies must address not only collection and access to transactional information, but also its timely disposal. One unintended side effect of data retention is the disappearance of social forgetfulness, which allows individuals a second chance, the opportunity for a fresh start in life. We examine three domains in which social policy has explicitly recognized the importance of such a principle: bankruptcy law, juvenile crime records, and credit reports. In each case, we frame the issue in terms of the social benefits of forgetfulness, rather than in terms of individual privacy protection. We examine how different policy approaches to privacy might handle the retention of data and propose a comprehensive policy that includes a variety of strategies. The broad conclusion of the article is that data retention and disposal should be addressed as a part of a broader and comprehensive policy approach, rather than in a piecemeal fashion or as an afterthought.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIT.2005.844059},
	abstract = {We present a new method for clustering based on compression. The method does not use subject-specific features or background knowledge, and works as follows: First, we determine a parameter-free, universal, similarity distance, the normalized compression distance or NCD, computed from the lengths of compressed data files (singly and in pairwise concatenation). Second, we apply a hierarchical clustering method. The NCD is not restricted to a specific application area, and works across application area boundaries. A theoretical precursor, the normalized information distance, co-developed by one of the authors, is provably optimal. However, the optimality comes at the price of using the noncomputable notion of Kolmogorov complexity. We propose axioms to capture the real-world setting, and show that the NCD approximates optimality. To extract a hierarchy of clusters from the distance matrix, we determine a dendrogram (ternary tree) by a new quartet method and a fast heuristic to implement it. The method is implemented and available as public software, and is robust under choice of different compressors. To substantiate our claims of universality and robustness, we report evidence of successful application in areas as diverse as genomics, virology, languages, literature, music, handwritten digits, astronomy, and combinations of objects from completely different domains, using statistical, dictionary, and block sorting compressors. In genomics, we presented new evidence for major questions in Mammalian evolution, based on whole-mitochondrial genomic analysis: the Eutherian orders and the Marsupionta hypothesis against the Theria hypothesis.},

	volume = {99},
	abstract = {For much of the last forty years, certain shared epistemological concerns have guided
research in both the history and the philosophy of science: the testing of theory (including
the replication of experiments), the assessment of evidence, the bearing of theoretical and
metaphysical assumptions on the reality of scientific objects, and, above all, the interaction
of subjective and objective factors in scientific inquiry. This essay proposes a turn toward
ontology—more specifically, toward the ontologies created and sustained by scientific
observation. Such a shift in focus would invite a rethinking of the neo-Kantian distinctions
(along with their characteristic metaphors, such as “lenses,” “filters,” and “perspectives”)
that have, implicitly or explicitly, informed much of late twentieth-century history and
philosophy of science. In particular, the current gap between psychology and epistemology
might be bridged, if the psychology in question were collective rather than individual
and the epistemology oriented toward discovery rather than warranting and testing},

A sample of 515 children (172 African Americans and 343 Caucasian Americans), average age 12 years old, completed surveys as part of their participation in the Children and Technology Project. Findings indicated race and gender differences in the intensity of IT use; African American males were the least intense users of computers and the Internet, and African American females were the most intense users of the Internet. Males, regardless of race, were the most intense videogame players, and females,
regardless of race, were the most intense cell phone users. IT use predicted children’s academic performance. Length of time using computers and the Internet was a positive predictor of academic performance, whereas amount of time spent playing videogames was a negative predictor. Implications of the findings for bringing IT to African American males and bringing African American males to IT are discussed.},

Conventional approaches to primary source research on the economic and environmental implications of globalised commodity flows typically restrict researchers to specific locations or a small handful of commodities. By taking advantage of cutting-edge computational tools, the project was able to address much larger data sets for historical research, and thereby provides historians with the means to develop new data-driven research questions. In particular, this project has demonstrated that text mining techniques applied to tens of thousands of documents about nineteenth-century commodity trading can yield a novel understanding of how economic forces connected distant places all over the globe and how efforts to generate wealth from natural resources impacted on local environments.},

	abstract = {Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the reflection on their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing. It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.
By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities, research, and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously.},

Each team provided a complete and complementary digital research resource – the online trial records of the Old Bailey (UK), the bibliographical management software (USA), and the text analysis portal (Canada) – with the shared goal of creating a linked research environment where it would be possible to:
1. Query the Old Bailey site
2. Save different result sets directly to a Zotero library where they could be managed
3. Send the results from Zotero to text analysis and visualization tools like Voyeur
In each case, existing tools were augmented and enhanced to allow for seamless integration. More generally, DMCI aimed to discover what tools and infrastructure would enable the ‘ordinary working historian’ (OWH) to integrate text mining into her or his day-to-day work.
The Old Bailey contains about 127 million words of text related to past crimes. Knowing that a myriad of unusual and compelling stories can be found in this resource, especially using tools that go beyond reading individual trials, we aimed to construct a way to zoom out to look at statistically significant patterns in the data and to zoom in to consider cases.
This white paper begins with a discussion of our technical developments, moves to textual discoveries, considers the challenges and opportunities this model of research presents to historians, and reveals some of the larger historical trends these tools have illuminated in the data.},

We propose an approach based upon the storage of the digital objects that comprise the collec- tion, augmented with the meta-data attributes needed to dynamically re-create the data collection. This approach builds upon the technology needed to support extensible database schema, which in turn enables the creation of data-handling systems that support replicated data sets within federated archives.},

Much of the debate about this proposed change focused on the value of traditional printed sources in the Information Age. This essay looks at this debate in three contexts: the nature of documentary editing; the relationships and respective missions of historians, documentary editors, and archivists; and the nature of records and recordkeeping technologies. My perspective is that of an archivist, and my conclusion is that documentary editing needs to re-orient itself to using new technologies to provide access to the archival documents managed by the editorial projects.},

	abstract = {The Struggle to Establish a National Archives in the United States
rom the beginning of the Republic, there Fwas concern for preserving its records. The secretary of the Continental Con- ress, Charles Thomson, labored during his fifteen years of service to record the infant government's business for posterity. Ebenezer Hazard sought and received from Congress in 1778 funds to collect state papers in order to
document the history of the United States. If only to facilitate the government's work, various federal administrators and clerks followed up these promising beginnings by caring for their records as the capital moved from one town to another during the 1780s and 1790s. 1
The United States in 1800 was not greatly dif- ferent from most European countries in safe- keeping the records of the national government. But change was in the air. Some German prin- cipalities had already begun establishing the forerunners of archives, and France during the 1790s was developing its pioneering Archives Nationales. During the nineteenth century most European countries would establish national ar- chival institutions, and French, German, and Dutch archivists would develop an impressive body of archival theory and practice. The United States was, however, left at the starting gate. The development of European archival agencies and the establishment of history as a research discipline had negligible influence on how the government of the United States cared for its records. True, some Americans took note of de- velopments abroad, and many were alarmed by the parlous state of their nation's older records. However, while some improvements in records preservation and m·anagement were achieved randomly on the state and local levels, no sig- nificant changes were effected at the national level.2
As the government of the United States grew, the attention given to its records became a more serious issue. It was inevitable that disaster would strike. In 1800 and 1801 fire seriously damaged the records of the Departments of War and the Treasury. These were only the first two of many fires that jeopardized the government's records over the years. According to j. Franklin Jame- son, 254 fires occurred in federal offices between 1833 and 1915. Fire was only the most dramatic and visible threat to the safety of the federal government's records. Chemicals, extreme cold or heat, water, mold, insects, animals, and theft were among the others that took their toll. Moreover, negligence in arranging and storing rec- ords had its impact as many documents became impossible to find.},

Not only do social researchers encounter special limits, but they are also handicapped by a distorted and idealized picture of practices in the "hard sciences." Ironically, while often obliged to use data of lower quality, sociology employs standards for evaluating a theory that are not attained in the hard sciences. After a brief review of these obstacles, we describe a set of procedures for using empirical data to rigorously evaluate theories and hypotheses without resorting to the mimicking of hard science. The interaction between theory and evidence normally involves deriving implications from the theory (usually referred to as hypotheses) and then ascertaining how closely the empirical evidence meets these implications. The appropriateness of the implications is a key factor in the entire operation, linking as they do the data and the theory. The evaluation of a theory is no better than the theory's implications (as generated by the investigator) coupled with the quality and appropriateness of the evidence. It is our impression, however, that because this step is insufficiently addressed, there are unnecessary problems in the evaluation of theories. We use the term "Implication Analysis" to describe our efforts to review and improve current procedures.},

	abstract = {Human language is based on grammatical rules. Cultural evolution allows these rules to change over time. Rules compete with each other: as new rules rise to prominence, old ones die away. To quantify the dynamics of language evolution, we studied the regularization of English verbs over the past 1,200 years. Although an elaborate system of productive conjugations existed in English’s proto-Germanic ancestor, Modern English uses the dental suffix, ‘-ed’, to signify past tense. Here we describe the emergence of this linguistic rule amidst the evolutionary decay of its exceptions, known to us as irregular verbs. We have generated a data set of verbs whose conjugations have been evolving for more than a millennium, tracking inflectional changes to 177 Old-English irregular verbs. Of these irregular verbs, 145 remained irregular in Middle English and 98 are still irregular today. We study how the rate of regularization depends on the frequency of word usage. The half-life of an irregular verb scales as the square root of its usage frequency: a verb that is 100 times less frequent regularizes 10 times as fast. Our study provides a quantitative analysis of the regularization process by which ancestral forms gradually yield to an emerging linguistic rule.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-term, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

We compare the results of these tests with those produced by WordNet-based similarity measures. One of the benchmarks is Miller and Charles' list of 30 noun pairs to which human judges had assigned similarity measures. We correlate these measures with those computed by several NLP systems. The 30 pairs can be traced back to Rubenstein and Goodenough's 65 pairs, which we have also studied. Our Roget's-based system gets correlations of .878 for the smaller and .818 for the larger list of noun pairs; this is quite close to the .885 that Resnik obtained when he employed humans to replicate the Miller and Charles experiment. We further evaluate our measure by using Roget's and WordNet to answer 80 TOEFL, 50 ESL and 300 Reader's Digest questions: the correct synonym must be selected amongst a group of four words. Our system gets 78.75\%, 82.00\% and 74.33\% of the questions respectively.},

	abstract = {Literature is a form of expression whose temporal structure, both in content and style, provides a historical record of the evolution of culture. In this work we take on a quantitative analysis of literary style and conduct the first large-scale temporal stylometric study of literature by using the vast holdings in the Project Gutenberg Digital Library corpus. We find temporal stylistic localization among authors through the analysis of the similarity structure in feature vectors derived from content-free word usage, nonhomogeneous decay rates of stylistic influence, and an accelerating rate of decay of influence among modern authors. Within a given time period we also find evidence for stylistic coherence with a given literary topic, such that writers in different fields adopt different literary styles. This study gives quantitative support to the notion of a literary “style of a time” with a strong trend toward increasingly contemporaneous stylistic influence.},

	abstract = {The jury trial is a critical point where the state and its citizens come together to define the limits of acceptable behavior. Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-term, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

In recent years, there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of courses and degree programmes in humanities computing. This paper presents some reflections on the status of humanities computing in higher education, in terms of curricula, degrees, and international student and staff mobility. The most important issue is the question of what a humanities computing degree should offer, in view of the wide interdisciplinarity of the field. Different institutions have coped with this question in very different ways. With potentially far‐reaching consequences on methodology in the various relevant disciplines, humanities computing is bound to change both what and how humanities students learn. Curriculum innovation that aims to integrate computing in the humanities is a difficult process that requires reflection, co‐operation, teacher training, and other supporting actions.},

	abstract = {Why in the articulation of archaeological knowledge have wider sensory properties of                 the material world been over looked? This article considers this question                 in relation to sound. It argues that the neglect of sound is partly the product of                 human transactions with instruments and media in practice. Moreover, the denial of                 sound as a relevant category of archaeological inquiry arises out of modernist                 notions of space-time that reside at the heart of the discipline. So while the                 visual is linked with spatial properties that are resistant to change, the aural is                 connected with the temporal and is considered momentary and fleeting in nature.                 Still, it is argued that sound as a quality of things is fundamental to human                 sensation - to being. In building upon a non-modernist notion of time where entities                 and events quite distant in a linear temporality are proximate through their                 simultaneous entanglement and percolation I suggest we might learn what we can                 understand from tuning into the acoustic properties of the material past. But rather                 than reproduce an unnecessary dualism between seeing and hearing, this endeavor will                 require us to relearn how to see and hear at the same time through other,                 complimentary modes of articulation and engagement.},

Instead of firing up the microfilm reader to navigate the Globe and Mail or the Toronto Star, one needs only to log into online newspaper databases. A keyword search, for a particular event, person, or cultural phenomenon, brings up a list of research findings. Previously impossible research projects can now be attempted. This process has fundamentally reshaped Canadian historical scholarship. We can see this in Canadian history dissertations. In 1998, a year with 67 dissertations, the Toronto Star was cited 74 times. However it was cited 753 times in 2010, a year with 69 dissertations. Similar data appears in the Canadian Historical Review (CHR), a prestigious peer-reviewed journal. Databases are skewing our research. We are witnessing the application of commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology - originally and primarily designed for the efficient digitization of large reams of corporate and legal documents, conventionally formatted - to historical sources. The results are, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. In this article, I make two arguments. Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely - if ever - made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these sources. (English)},

In the past year, at least three major humanities computing centers have seen significant changes in their structure. The work of Oxford's Humanities Computing Unit has been integrated into the larger organizational structure of Oxford University Computing Services.

	abstract = {Why in the articulation of archaeological knowledge have wider sensory properties of                 the material world been over looked? This article considers this question                 in relation to sound. It argues that the neglect of sound is partly the product of                 human transactions with instruments and media in practice. Moreover, the denial of                 sound as a relevant category of archaeological inquiry arises out of modernist                 notions of space-time that reside at the heart of the discipline. So while the                 visual is linked with spatial properties that are resistant to change, the aural is                 connected with the temporal and is considered momentary and fleeting in nature.                 Still, it is argued that sound as a quality of things is fundamental to human                 sensation - to being. In building upon a non-modernist notion of time where entities                 and events quite distant in a linear temporality are proximate through their                 simultaneous entanglement and percolation I suggest we might learn what we can                 understand from tuning into the acoustic properties of the material past. But rather                 than reproduce an unnecessary dualism between seeing and hearing, this endeavor will                 require us to relearn how to see and hear at the same time through other,                 complimentary modes of articulation and engagement.},

It engages philosophical, historical, ethnographic and critical perspectives to show how computing helps us fulfil the basic mandate of the humane sciences to ask ever better questions. It explores the challenges of imagining and constructing new scholarly resources. It strengthens current practice by stimulating debate on the role of the computer across all disciplines, examining and developing the key notions of collaboration and interdisciplinarity. It gives practitioners a way of conceptualising their practice as an ongoing anthropological encounter, and it gives those with whom they interact a new way of understanding the interdisciplinary language of method. It sketches the complex amalgam of computer science and suggests the basis for a productive relationship. It outlines an agenda for the field to which individual scholars can contribute.},

	abstract = {Roy Rosenzweig considers two sharply different futures that confront historians in the digital era. On the one hand, he explains, no one has figured out how to ensure that the digital present will be available to the future's historians. Every day, vast quantities of digital documentation are being generated without the technical, social, economic, or legal structures that would guarantee their preservation. And yet on the other hand, Rosenzweig insists, if these are solved, in whole or in part, then historians will face a second, profound challenge: What would it be like to write history with an essentially complete historical record? Consequently, he maintains, historians may be facing a fundamental paradigm shift from a culture of scarcity to a culture of abundance. As a result of these two developments, we need to think simultaneously about how to research, write, and teach in a world of unheard-of historical abundance and how to avoid a future of record scarcity. However, he tells us, even though these prospects have occasioned enormous commentary among librarians, archivists, and computer scientists, historians have almost entirely ignored them. Rosenzweig argues that this neglect must stop. We must shift our attention from the past to the present and future and embrace a broadened professional agenda--one, ironically, that was more common among historians a hundred years ago. Rosenzweig's essay is intended to spark discussion about reviving that agenda. [PUBLICATION ]},

The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a "flythrough" of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.},

	abstract = {Digital humanities (DH) is an area of scholarly activity at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities. It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the reflection on their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing. It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution.
By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities, research, and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously.},

The contours of a third wave of computational history are outlined, a trend marked by ever-increasing amounts of digitized information (especially web based), falling digital storage costs, a move to the cloud, and a corresponding increase in computational power to process these sources. Following this, the article uses a case study of an early born-digital archive at Library and Archives Canada – Canada’s Digital Collections project (CDC) – to bring some of these problems into view. An array of off-the-shelf data analysis solutions, coupled with code written in Mathematica, helps us bring context and retrieve information from a digital collection on a previously inaccessible scale. The article concludes with an illustration of the various computational tools available, as well as a call for greater digital literacy in history curricula and professional development.},

	url = {https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub92/hirtle/},
	abstract = {by Peter B. Hirtle Archival Authenticity: An Example Downtown Baltimore is a vibrant, dynamic place filled with new office towers and hotels that rise above shops, plazas, and museums. At the heart of Baltimore is the Inner Harbor, an area that is crowded year-round with residents and tourists who are sightseeing, dining, shopping, or watching baseball at nearby Camden Yards. Over the past two decades, the Inner Harbor has become the living center of a revitalized downtown. The defining feature of Baltimore’s Inner Harbor, unlike that of so many American cities, is not a glass structure, a shining space needle, or a distinctive sculpture. The Harbor is marked instead by the sturdy masts and graceful spars of the USS Constellation, a historic wooden-hulled naval vessel permanently moored there. The famous ship arrived in Baltimore in 1955, and for the next 35 years, the city celebrated its frigate, taking pride in the illustrious history of a ship that had been built in Baltimore in 1797 as a sister ship to the equally famous USS Constitution anchoredin Boston. The story of the Constellation took a different turn in 1991, however, with the publication of Fouled Anchors: The Constellation Question Answered, a report by Dana Wegner, the chief of ship models at the U.S. Navy’s David W. Taylor Research Center in Carderock, Maryland. Rumors had circulated for half a century that the Constellation was not what its promoters claimed it to be, and Wegner’s report confirmed them. Investigators from the Navy discovered that the supposed Revolutionary War-era frigate in Baltimore Harbor was actually a Civil War era sloop that had been built in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1854. All it shared with the frigate built in Baltimore in the eighteenth century was its name. It resembled a Revolutionary War-era frigate because during early renovations, some of the ship’s admirers had “restored” the Constellation to appear to be almost 60 years older than it was; for example, they added a second gun deck and made other alterations. For most of its tenure in Baltimore, the Constellation was living a lie (Wegner 1991; LeDuc 1999). Many themes are at work in the story of the true identity of the Constellation. Early citizens of Baltimore, for example, seemed to have a stronger need to connect to the Revolutionary War than to the Civil War. They may have felt that “older is better,” and that the ship would be of greatest interest if it was thought to have a Baltimore connection (i.e., if it had been built there). Nonetheless, their distortion of history came at the expense of the Constellation’s very interesting own history. It was, for example, the last and largest all sail-powered sloop commissioned by the U.S. Navy, and while it did not engage in a famous sea battle, as did its predecessor, it did work to interdict the slave trade during the mid-1800s. The most interesting themes in the Constellation story, however, revolve around the issue of authenticity-not the authenticity of the ship itself, but rather the authenticity of the documentation about the ship. For it was not just the appearance of the ship that was “forged,” but also the written record concerning the ship. Some of the changes to the written record may not have been an intentional effort at deceit. Between 1854 and 1908, for example, the annual reports of the Navy listed the ship as having been built in Norfolk in 1854; however, from 1909 onward, the reports listed the ship as having been built in Baltimore in 1797. Was this an intentional effort to deceive or an honest effort to correct what naval officers may have thought was a past mistake? Wegner could not determine the answer. In the 1950s, however, documents began to appear that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigators later determined were forged. One document, allegedly written in 1918, was found to have been written with a typewriter made after 1946. Some of the forged documents in the possession of researchers bore forged stamps indicating that they were copies of records found in the National Archives. Other forged documents were inserted into historical files at the National Archives and at the Franklin Roosevelt Presidential Library, where they were subsequently “found” by researchers. The need to alter the archival written record to conform to a particular historical interpretation speaks to the power of archives to authenticate. At rest in Baltimore Harbor was a physical artifact, a wooden ship, measuring over 180 feet long and weighing several hundred tons. The existence of the artifact per se, however, was not enough to establish its authenticity. To confirm beyond doubt the nature and history of the Constellation, both supporters and critics of the “Constellation as frigate” theory turned to a few sheets of paper housed in a few archives. What characteristics of traditional analog archives give them the power to authenticate? And how can this power be maintained in the digital world, both for archives and for other cultural heritage repositories in general? The Nature of Archives To understand why users turn to and trust information found in analog archives, it is necessary to understand the nature of archives. In the vernacular, the word archives has come to mean anything that is old or established, be it collections of old movies (such as the Pacific Film Archive), a journal that publishes what the editors hope will be papers of enduring value (for example Virchows Archiv, the official journal of the European Society of Pathology), or even rock-and-roll oldies on cable television (in the VH1 Archives) (Maher 1997). Even information professionals have not been loath to extend the definition of archives beyond that found in the American Library Association (ALA) Glossary or other official lexicons when they speak of “digital archiving,” a generic term for the preservation of electronic information. While archivists often inherit responsibility for old things, a collection of historic documents or artifacts, in and of itself, does not make an archives. A true archives is a contextually based organic body Read More},

Here we present a large-scale quantitative analysis of trial transcripts from the Old Bailey that reveal a major transition in the nature of this defining moment. By coarse-graining the spoken-word testimony into synonym sets and dividing the trials based on indictment, we demonstrate the emergence of semantically distinct violent and nonviolent trial genres. We show that although in the late 18th century the semantic content of trials for violent offenses is functionally indistinguishable from that for nonviolent ones, a long-terms, secular trend drives the system toward increasingly clear distinctions between violent and nonviolent acts. We separate this process into the shifting patterns that drive it, determine the relative effects of bureaucratic change and broader cultural shifts, and identify the synonym sets most responsible for the eventual genre distinguishability. This work provides a new window onto the cultural and institutional changes that accompany the monopolization of violence by the state, described in qualitative historical analysis as the civilizing process.},

Serious interpersonal violence decreased remarkably in Europe between the mid-sixteenth and the early twentieth centuries. Different long-term trajectories in the decline of homicide can be distinguished between various European regions. Age and sex patterns in serious violent offending, however, have changed very little over several centuries. The long-term decline in homicide rates seems to go along with a disproportionate decline in elite homicide and a drop in male-to-male conflicts in public space. A range of theoretical explanations for the long-term decline have been offered, including the effects of the civilizing process, strengthening state powers, the Protestant Reformation, and modern individualism, but most theorizing has been post-hoc.},

Instead of firing up the microfilm reader to navigate the Globe and Mail or the Toronto Star, one needs only to log into online newspaper databases. A keyword search, for a particular event, person, or cultural phenomenon, brings up a list of research findings. Previously impossible research projects can now be attempted. This process has fundamentally reshaped Canadian historical scholarship. We can see this in Canadian history dissertations. In 1998, a year with 67 dissertations, the Toronto Star was cited 74 times. However it was cited 753 times in 2010, a year with 69 dissertations. Similar data appears in the Canadian Historical Review (CHR), a prestigious peer-reviewed journal. Databases are skewing our research. We are witnessing the application of commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology--originally and primarily designed for the efficient digitization of large reams of corporate and legal documents, conventionally formatted--to historical sources. The results are, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. In this article, I make two arguments. Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely--if ever--made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databses. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these resources.},

Findings indicated race and gender differences in the intensity of IT use; African American males were the least intense users of computers and the Internet, and African American females were the most intense users of the Internet. Males, regardless of race, were the most intense videogame players, and females, regardless of race, were the most intense cell phone users. IT use predicted children's academic performance. Length of time using computers and the Internet was a positive predictor of academic performance, whereas amount of time spent playing videogames was a negative predictor. Implications of the findings for bringing IT to African American males and bringing African American males to IT are discussed.},

On the one hand, he explains, no one has figured out how to ensure that the digital present will be available to the future's historians. Every day, vast quantities of digital documentation are being generated without the technical, social, economic, or legal structures that would guarantee their preservation. And yet on the other hand, Rosenzweig insists, if these are solved, in whole or in part, then historians will face a second, profound challenge: What would it be like to write history with an essentially complete historical record? Consequently, he maintains, historians may be facing a fundamental paradigm shift from a culture of scarcity to a culture of abundance. As a result of these two developments, we need to think simultaneously about how to research, write, and teach in a world of unheard-of historical abundance and how to avoid a future of record scarcity. However, he tells us, even though these prospects have occasioned enormous commentary among librarians, archivists, and computer scientists, historians have almost entirely ignored them. Rosenzweig argues that this neglect must stop. We must shift our attention from the past to the present and future and embrace a broadened professional agenda--one, ironically, that was more common among historians a hundred years ago. Rosenzweig's essay is intended to spark discussion about reviving that agenda. [PUBLICATION ]},

	abstract = {It all seems so orderly and comprehensive. Instead of firing up the micro-film reader to navigate the Globe and Mail or the Toronto Star, one needs only to log into online newspaper databases. A keyword search, for a particular event, person, or cultural phenomenon, brings up a list of research findings. Previously impossible research projects can now be attempted. This process has fundamentally reshaped Canadian historical scholarship. We can see this in Canadian history dissertations. In 1998, a year with 67 dissertations, the Toronto Star was cited 74 times. However it was cited 753 times in 2010, a year with 69 dissertations. Similar data appears in the Canadian Historical Review (CHR), a prestigious peer-reviewed journal. Databases are skewing our research. We are witnessing the application of commercial Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology – originally and primarily designed for the efficient digitization of large reams of corporate and legal documents, conventionally formatted – to historical sources. The results are, unsurprisingly, a mixed bag. In this article, I make two arguments. Firstly, online historical databases have profoundly shaped Canadian historiography. In a shift that is rarely – if ever – made explicit, Canadian historians have profoundly reacted to the availability of online databases. Secondly, historians need to understand how OCR works, in order to bring a level of methodological rigor to their work that use these sources. ; Ça paraît si bien classé, si complet. Au lieu d’allumer le lecteur de microfilms pour sillonner le Globe and Mail ou le Toronto Star, on a seulement besoin de se connecter aux bases de données en ligne des journaux. Pour tout événement, toute personne ou tout phénomène culturel, une recherche par mot clé génère une liste de résultats. Des projets de recherche autrefois impossibles sont maintenant lancés. La recherche de pointe en histoire au Canada a été radicalement transformée, et les thèses en histoire canadienne nous le prouvent. Les 67 thèses déposées en 1998 ont cité le Toronto Star 74 fois; les 69 thèses déposées en 2010 l’ont plutôt cité 753 fois. Des données semblables s’observent dans la Canadian Historical Review (CHR), une prestigieuse revue périodique à comité de lecture. Les bases de données biaisent la recherche. La technologie commerciale de reconnaissance de caractères, initialement et principalement conçue pour numériser efficacement d’énormes quantités de documents d’entreprise ou juridiques à la mise en forme conventionnelle, s’applique désormais aux sources en histoire avec, sans surprise, des résultats qui laissent parfois à désirer. Je défendrai deux idées dans cet article. Premièrement, les bases de données historiques en ligne ont profondément marqué l’historiographie canadienne. On admet peu, si tant est qu’on le fasse, à quel point les historiens canadiens ont investi les bases de données en ligne. Deuxièmement, les historiens doivent comprendre comment fonctionne la reconnaissance de caractères pour garantir la rigueur méthodologique de leurs travaux fondés sur ces sources.},

It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations.

It is argued that where one grammatical option replaces another across a set of linguistic contexts, the rate of replacement can be shown to be the same in all those contexts, regardless of differences in the degree to which they may favor the new form. It is argued that the set of contexts that changes together is not usually defined by an obvious surface property, but by a shared syntactic structure. A detailed analysis is presented of the rise of the periphrastic auxiliary do in Late Middle English \& Early Modern English. Other English data also support the constant rate hypothesis. It is shown that the fact that change arises first in contexts that favor the change functionally allows quantitative study of the causation of change. These causes of change should be sought at abstract levels of structure, particularly where entire grammatical subsystems may be involved. 12 Tables, 8 Figures, 57 References. B. Annesser Murray},

	abstract = {The digital humanities is increasingly becoming a "buzzword", and there is more and more talk about a broadly conceived, inclusive digital humanities. The field is expanding and at the same time being negotiated, and this article explores the idea of a broadly conceived landscape of digital humanities in some depth. It is argued that awareness across this landscape is important to the future of the field. The study starts out from typologies of digital humanities, a "flythrough" of the landscape, and a discussion of what being a digital humanist entails. The second part is an exploration of four concrete encounters: ACTLab at University of Texas at Austin, the Humanities Arts Science Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC), the Humanities Computing Program at the University of Alberta, and Internet Studies. In the third part of the article, it is suggested that a model based on paradigmatic modes of engagement between the humanities and information technology can help chart and understand the digital humanities. The modes of engagement analyzed are technology as a tool, study object, expressive medium, exploratory laboratory and activist venue.},

The site describes itself as a cartographic narrative that examines in great textual and visual detail three interconnected slave revolts and the colonial and imperial military responses that they engendered. In the words of Vincent Brown, the Web site's creator, this site suggests an argument about the relationship between the strategies employed by the rebels and their opponents and the landscape in which these events played out. In so doing, it not only integrates spatial, social, and military history, but it presents the idea that this insurrection was a well-planned affair that posed a genuine strategic threat to white dominance in Jamaica, rather than, as historians have often dismissed slave insurrections, merely a series of opportunistic riots or a threat blown out of proportion by panicked whites.},

	abstract = {Abstract For much of the last forty years, certain shared epistemological concerns have guided research in both the history and the philosophy of science: the testing of theory (including the replication of experiments), the assessment of evidence, the bearing of theoretical and metaphysical assumptions on the reality of scientific objects, and, above all, the interaction of subjective and objective factors in scientific inquiry. This essay proposes a turn toward ontology—more specifically, toward the ontologies created and sustained by scientific observation. Such a shift in focus would invite a rethinking of the neo‐Kantian distinctions (along with their characteristic metaphors, such as “lenses,” “filters,” and “perspectives”) that have, implicitly or explicitly, informed much of late twentieth‐century history and philosophy of science. In particular, the current gap between psychology and epistemology might be bridged, if the psychology in question were collective rather than individual and the epistemology oriented toward discovery rather than warranting and testing.},

My essay responds to what I discern as Baker's four main points - a lie foisted upon the public about the care of the newspapers, the insidious destruction of original newspapers, the resultant loss of trust by the public in libraries and archives, and a set of wrong priorities leading to the misguided microfilming and destruction of the newspapers. My essay also suggests that we should expect more such public debates as the developing Digital Age brings more intense concerns for original books, archives, and other documents.},
